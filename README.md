CUTLER
======

An opinionated web development boilerplate, focussed on offering components that work well together while providing a very small filesize footprint and no need to overwrite options as often the case with Bootstrap or Foundation.

It features:

* customized Normalize.css
* a designer-friendly fluid (percentage-based), responsive grid layout with fixed (pixel-based) gutters
* optional equal-height grid boxes & a sensible inner padding solution
* optional slide-like layouts with orientation settings for humans
* responsive font-sizing
* proper font-size hierarchy based on Fibonacci / Lucas sequences
* tons of valuable readability enhancements
* fixes for forms, media controls, highlighting on mobile etc.


Need to support legacy browsers / plattforms? Cutler's got you covered! It even works on:

* Internet Explorer 8 (without the responsive bits & minor usability enhancements)
* iOS 4
* Opera 12.10
* ... all of course all modern browsers
